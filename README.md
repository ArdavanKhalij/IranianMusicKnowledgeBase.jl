## About the project

This package is a concrete implementation of [CHARM](https://github.com/nick-harley/Charm), and [CHAKRA](https://github.com/nick-harley/Chakra) for the Iranian traditional music.</br></br>
These systems are designed to deal with Western music, so the main challenge and work were adding the logic, new structures, and music theory of Iranian traditional music.</br></br>
An example of these extra components is Sori and Koron, which are a quarter of note and are essential and widespread in Iranian music. The other critical case that adds to the difficulties of representing Iranian music is Dastgah and Maqam. These are music structures with a specific combination of notes and structures similar to Western musicâ€™s mode. </br></br>
Other music representation challenges must be addressed before the statistical model is built. These new structures have been added to CHARM and CHAKRA.</br></br>
